## üß™ Lab Challenges

Below are some of the lab-based challenges I've completed as part of my ongoing cybersecurity and IT training. These experiences reflect my practical skills and problem-solving ability in real-world scenarios.

### üîê TryHackMe ‚Äì Introduction to Network Traffic Analysis

**Problem Statement:**  
Understand how to analyze and interpret network traffic using tools like Wireshark. The objective was to detect suspicious traffic and understand common protocols.

**Approach:**  
I analyzed `.pcap` files to filter and dissect packets. I investigated packet flow patterns and practiced identifying potential threats.

**Tools Used:**  
- Wireshark  
- TCPDump  
- TryHackMe platform  

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- How to apply display filters in Wireshark  
- Recognizing unusual traffic patterns and behaviors  
- Using packet data to uncover basic threat indicators

### üåê TryHackMe ‚Äì Domain Name System (DNS)

**Problem Statement:**  
Explore how DNS functions, including the hierarchy, different record types, and DNS query resolution.

**Approach:**  
Practiced querying DNS records using `dig` and `nslookup`, followed domain resolution paths, and identified roles of authoritative name servers.

**Tools Used:**  
- Dig  
- Nslookup  
- TryHackMe Labs  

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Importance of the domain hierarchy (root, TLD, authoritative servers)  
- Understanding and querying A, AAAA, MX, TXT, and CNAME records  
- DNS as a potential attack vector (DNS hijacking, tunneling)

### üï∏Ô∏è TryHackMe ‚Äì Web Requests

**Problem Statement:**  
Understand how web requests work, including the role of HTTP methods, headers, and request/response cycles.

**Approach:**  
Captured HTTP requests using Burp Suite, examined header information, and replayed requests to analyze server behavior.

**Tools Used:**  
- Burp Suite  
- Postman  
- TryHackMe Labs  

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Structure of HTTP requests and common status codes  
- Security concerns in improperly validated user input  
- Hands-on exposure to web interception and request modification
